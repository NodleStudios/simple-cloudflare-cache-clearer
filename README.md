This is a very simple plugin that does two things.

1. Adds an admin menu item at the top of the admin to "Clear CF Cache" - no more clicking into Settings > Cloudflare > Purge Cache > Purge Everything.
2. If you are hosting your site on SpinupWP, when you click "Purge All Caches" in the SpinupWP cache dropdown once SpinupWP's page cache is purged this plugin will also cleare the Cloudflare cache
